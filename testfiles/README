H2O is not a good test molecule for cholesky because of the degeneracy
caused by the equivalent hydrogens. This causes random pivot point that
in the end don't really matter but will cause the strict tests to fail.


The dmo-aug-cc-pvtz test fails a few tests. I'll have to think of a better
way to calculate sum and checksum. This is almost certainly due to accumulation
of error.
