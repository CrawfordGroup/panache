- In density fitting, the transformation with C matrices
  can be done before the contraction with the metric. In doing
  so, the contraction with the metric is much faster, in particular
  with the OO and OV blocks.

  This, however, comes at the expense of disk IO when storing to disk.
  There would be a great speedup in memory, however, particuarly for OO blocks.

  This will require the GenDFQso functions to be replaced, more or less, and to
  take a vector of C matrices like the transformation function does.

  Outline:
    Loop over q
      Generate all ij for a particular shell index q
      Transform with necessary C matrices
      Write (to mem/disk)

    Read tensor
    Contract with J
    Write tensor again
