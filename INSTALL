libPANACHE Compilation/Installation
===================================


















--------------
CMake options
--------------

LIBINT_PATH
LIBINT2_PATH

    Path to the top level directory of libint or libint2. This directory
    structure should be:

    LIBINT2_PATH
        include
           libint2
                libint2.h
                (others) 
        lib
            libint2.a

    or

    LIBINT_PATH
        include
            libint
                libtint.h
                (others)
        lib
            libint.a



USE_64LAPACK            

    Enable if you plan on linking to 64-bit lapack or MKL (ie mkl ilp64
    libraries)


PANACHE_OPENMP

    Enable OpenMP. Whether or not OpenMP is used depends on if your
    compiler supports it.


PANACHE_TIMING

    Enable timing of some functions. Timings will be printed to the
    usual output


PANACHE_DISKPREFETCH

    Prefetching of the next batch from disk. Highly experimental, and
    requires a very new compiler (GCC 4.8 or Intel 15 [beta]).


USE_64PANACHE

    Use 64-bit C/Fortran interfaces to libpanache. May be required if
    compiling the Fortran code with 64-bit integers.
