\section runtest_sec Runtest

PANACHE ships with a testing program to check the integrity of the generated code. This
program is called <b>runtest</b> and is located in the runtest subdirectory of the build directory (or the
bin directory of the install prefix).

<b>runtest</b> allows for testing much of the functionality, including generation of Qso (with density fitting and cholesky), transformation of Qso to Qmo, Qoo, etc., and reading/iterating over these three-index tensors.
Timing information can also be printed, allowing for some benchmarking.

The main argument to <b>runtest</b> is a directory containing test files. These are stored in the 'testfiles' directory of the source tree. Currently, testing is carried out with dimethyloxirane with various basis sets.

Other options are documented in the program's help. See 'runtest -h' for details.
